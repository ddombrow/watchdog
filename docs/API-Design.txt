REST API Planning
------------------

/crimes -> collection of crimes in geojson
	- Params:
			keywords - comma separated list of keywords (example: ?keywords=assault,battery)
			points - comma separated coordinate list for distance within searches.  If multiple points are specified, the search will be based on distance from a linestring (example: ?points=37.68 -176,38.14 -177)  
			distance - distance in miles to search within (combines with the points param)
			type - filters based on types (the types are specified in the db)
			startTime - filters based on timestamp
			endTime - filters based on timestamp 
				(If only one time param is used, it searches before or after. If both are used, it searches between.)
			(planned but not implemented) area - pass an area id to search within an area that the system knows about (e.g. neighborhoods)
            (planned but not implemented)timeofday - pass a time of day range to search on
/crimes/? -> single crime based on case number
